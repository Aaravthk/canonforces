# Codeforces-Problem-of-The-Day
 Cannonforces is a game to improve your coding efficiency by solving short programming problems with other people, at the same time. Players share their solutions at the end of a game to help other players improve their coding skills.
 
We aim to build a 1 vs 1 coding platform for codeforces.
